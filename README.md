# Sensational-Stocks-Indicator
Dear Reader, 

Before you can take advantage of our stock market indicators, we would like to tell you how this group of five boys organized themselves to accomplish this project. It all stemmed from our university course, "Introduction to Programming," where we were required to learn the basics of programming by developing something together with other classmates. Therefore, as finance enthusiasts, our team decided to focus on creating an extension for the TradingView site, which allows adding more indicators on all stock charts, forex, etc. Each team member worked on a different task, between programming, code commentary, and implementation. Once the code was complete, we went through several rounds of review and debugging to ensure the indicators worked and minimized programming errors. Next, we focused on implementing the extension in TradingView. Once our extension is added to the site, you can choose any chart inherent in stocks, forex, and crypto, apply our indicators to simplify your strategy and get ready to make money. Have fun!
