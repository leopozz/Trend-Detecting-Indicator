# Trend-Detecting-Indicator
Dear Reader, 

Before you can take advantage of our stock market indicator, we would like to tell you how this group of five guys organized themselves to accomplish this project. It all stemmed from our university course, "Introduction to Programming," where we were required to learn the basics of programming by developing something together with other classmates. Therefore, as finance enthusiasts, our team decided to focus on creating an extension for the TradingView site, which allows adding more indicators on all stock charts, forex, crypto, and etc.

First, we focused on a frequent problem of traders and tried to find possible help. Our indicator's mixture of the two modules can be advantageous for a trader. Moving averages help detect the trend direction of a stock and allow the trader to identify support and resistance levels on the chart. However, they usually provide this information to the trader in the timeframe they are looking for. This means that if, for instance, the chart is on 30 minutes candles, the moving averages will show the trend, as well as support and resistances, for the 30-minute chart. This can be disadvantageous because the trader might receive short-term information but no long-term information. This can be best described by an example where a trader sees a bullish trend on the 30-minute chart while the daily chart shows a significant bearish trend. Therefore, our group decided to address this issue by providing the trader with moving averages based on the chart's timeframe and moving averages based on other timeframes so that the trader is no more biased by the lack of additional confirmation by other timeframes. Moreover, for the trader, it is more efficient to have all the information on one chart rather than constantly switching between different timeframes.

Each team member worked on a different task, between programming, code commentary, and implementation. Once the code was complete, we went through several rounds of review and debugging to ensure the indicator worked and minimized programming errors. Next, we focused on implementing the extension in TradingView. Once our extension is added to the site, you can choose any chart inherent in stocks, forex, and crypto, apply our indicators to simplify your strategy and get ready to make money. Have fun!

# Indicators and strategies:
